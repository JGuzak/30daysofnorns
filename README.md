# 30daysofnorns

My collection of psets from my 30 day norns 2022 journey.

## Requirements

Norns and the following scripts:
* [MLRE](https://github.com/sonocircuit/mlre)
* [Flora](https://norns.community/authors/jaseknighter/flora)

## Installing

Copy the contents of `\psets\` into `\dust\data` on norns. Alternatively, you can install just one script worth of psets by copying `\psets\{script}\` into `\dust\data\{script}` on norns.

*You can add these psets around your existing psets by modifying the number in the .pset file and session data folder to be unique from other psets on your norns.*

## MLRE PSETS

psets for MLRE consist of two parts, a `*mlre-**.pset` file and a folder in `\session\`.

The numbers in the `mlre-**.pset` file must match the associated session folder name.
