# 30daysofnorns

My collection of psets from my 30 day norns 2022 journey.

## Requirements

Norns and the following scripts:
* MLRE
* Flora

## Installing

Copy the contents of `psets\` into `\dust\data` on your norns.

## MLRE PSETS

psets for MLRE consist of two parts, a `*mlre-**.pset` file and a folder in `\session\`.

The numbers in the `mlre-**.pset` file must match the associated session folder name.
